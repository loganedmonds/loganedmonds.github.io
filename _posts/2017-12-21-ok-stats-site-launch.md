Time to finally put my collection of data analyses and random thoughts together! 
This site was put together with the help of Jonathan McGlone's [wonderful guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). 
The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and authored using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format for easy integration with [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).
